abstract = "The society is currently witnessing an unprecedented growth in the incidence of mental disorders, with an estimated 300 million people suffering from depression globally. People with high life satisfaction tend to suffer fewer mental health issues. The large volume of data generated on social network platforms enables us to detect hidden patterns in data and obtain new insights. This work aims to (a) explore the relationship between life satisfaction and depression in social network users, using Facebook as an example, and (b) develop a multilevel predictive model to detect users with depression. We trained a set of predictive models on datasets from myPersonality project including 2,085 participants who took the Satisfaction with Life Scale and 614 users who submitted the Centre for Epidemiological Study Depression (CES-D) scale. The resulting multilevel model establishes a negative correlation between life satisfaction and depression, and it can also improve the accuracy of a predictive model using depressive labels alone.",

abstract = {Twitter is increasingly investigated as a means of detecting mental health status, including depression and suicidality, in the population. However, validated and reliable methods are not yet fully established. This study aimed to examine whether the level of concern for a suicide-related post on Twitter could be determined based solely on the content of the post, as judged by human coders and then replicated by machine learning. From 18th February 2014 to 23rd April 2014, Twitter was monitored for a series of suicide-related phrases and terms using the public Application Program Interface (API). Matching tweets were stored in a data annotation tool developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). During this time, 14,701 suicide-related tweets were collected: 14\% were randomly (n=2000) selected and divided into two equal sets (Set A and B) for coding by human researchers. Overall, 14\% of suicide-related tweets were classified as ‘strongly concerning’, with the majority coded as ‘possibly concerning’ (56\%) and the remainder (29\%) considered ‘safe to ignore’. The overall agreement rate among the human coders was 76\% (average κ=0.55). Machine learning processes were subsequently applied to assess whether a ‘strongly concerning’ tweet could be identified automatically. The computer classifier correctly identified 80\% of ‘strongly concerning’ tweets and showed increasing gains in accuracy; however, future improvements are necessary as a plateau was not reached as the amount of data increased. The current study demonstrated that it is possible to distinguish the level of concern among suicide-related tweets, using both human coders and an automatic machine classifier. Importantly, the machine classifier replicated the accuracy of the human coders. The findings confirmed that Twitter is used by individuals to express suicidality and that such posts evoked a level of concern that warranted further investigation. However, the predictive power for actual suicidal behaviour is not yet known and the findings do not directly identify targets for intervention.}

Tens of millions of people each year suffer from depression and only a fraction receives adequate treatment. This position paper highlights some recent attempts examining the potential for leveraging social media postings as a new type of lens in understanding mental illness in individuals and populations. Information gleaned from social media bears potential to complement traditional survey techniques in its ability to provide finer grained measurements of behavior over time while radically expanding population sample sizes. We conclude highlighting how this research direction may be useful in developing tools for identifying the onset of depressive disorders in individuals, for use by healthcare agencies; or on behalf of individuals, enabling those suffering from mental illness to be more proactive about their mental health.},

abstract = {Automatic cyberbullying detection is a task of growing interest, particularly in the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning communities. Not only is it challenging, but it is also a relevant need given how social networks have become a vital part of individuals' lives and how dire the consequences of cyberbullying can be, especially among adolescents. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of 22 studies on automatic cyberbullying detection, complemented by an experiment to validate current practices through the analysis of two datasets. Results indicated that cyberbullying is often misrepresented in the literature, leading to inaccurate systems that would have little real-world application. Criteria concerning cyberbullying definitions and other methodological concerns seem to be often dismissed. Additionally, there is no uniformity regarding the methodology to evaluate said systems and the natural imbalance of datasets remains an issue. This paper aims to direct future research on the subject towards a viewpoint that is more coherent with the definition and representation of the phenomenon, so that future systems can have a practical and impactful application. Recommendations on future works are also made.}

Cyberbullying may cause many serious and negative impacts on a person's life and even lead to teen suicide. To reduce and stop cyberbullying, one effective solution is to automatically detect bullying content based on appropriate machine learning and natural language processing techniques. However, many existing approaches in the literature are just normal text classification models without considering bullying characteristics. In this paper, we propose a representation learning framework specific to cyberbullying detection. Based on word embeddings, we expand a list of pre-defined insulting words and assign different weights to obtain bullying features, which are then concatenated with Bag-of-Words and latent semantic features to form the final representation before feeding them into a linear SVM classifier. Experimental study on a twitter dataset is conducted, and our method is compared with several baseline text representation learning models and cyberbullying detection methods. The superior performance achieved by our method has been observed in this study.},

In recent years, Cyberbullying has grown into a major problem with the growth of online communication and social media. Cyberbullying has been recognized recently as a serious national health issue among online social network users and developing an efficient detection model holds tremendous practical significance. In this paper, we have proposed set of unique features derived from Twitter; network, activity, user, and tweet content, based on these feature, we developed a supervised machine learning solution for detecting cyberbullying in the Twitter. An evaluation demonstrates that our developed detection model based on our proposed features, achieved results with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.943 and an f-measure of 0.936. These results indicate that the proposed model based on these features provides a feasible solution to detecting Cyberbullying in online communication environments. Finally, we compare result obtained using our proposed features with the result obtained from two baseline features. The comparison outcomes show the significance of the proposed features. We propose a set of unique features based on tweets information to detect cyberbullying.Machine learning model based on the proposed features is developed.The developed model is effective in detecting cyberbullying in the Twitter network.},

Widely recognized for its potential to generate undue harm, the South Korean government has initiated a movement determined to block the participation of obscene content sharing between youths under the age of 18. While there may be different avenues to examine this phenomenon from, an approach notably absent from this list is the use of big data and data mining information produced via the dispersion of the Internet and social media. Using social big data, the study found that teenagers sexting in hopes of obtaining a higher volume of attention among friends; file sharing is more frequented than image distribution through sexting; and transactions without “adult pornography” and with “smishing” were the most influential in addressing the risks of sexting in South Korea. While big data and data mining do not make any inferences themselves, the benefits of analyzing social big data lies in its ability to incorporate a much larger volume of data and confirm the thoughts of a diverse range of participants.}

abstract="Background: Social media use is now ubiquitous, but the growth in social media communications has also made it a convenient digital platform for drug dealers selling controlled substances, opioids, and other illicit drugs. Previous studies and news investigations have reported the use of popular social media platforms as conduits for opioid sales. This study uses deep learning to detect illicit drug dealing on the image and video sharing platform Instagram. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a machine learning approach to detect Instagram posts related to illegal internet drug dealing. Methods: In this paper, we describe an approach to detect drug dealers by using a deep learning model on Instagram. We collected Instagram posts using a Web scraper between July 2018 and October 2018 and then compared our deep learning model against 3 different machine learning models (eg, random forest, decision tree, and support vector machine) to assess the performance and accuracy of the model. For our deep learning model, we used the long short-term memory unit in the recurrent neural network to learn the pattern of the text of drug dealing posts. We also manually annotated all posts collected to evaluate our model performance and to characterize drug selling conversations. Results: From the 12,857 posts we collected, we detected 1228 drug dealer posts comprising 267 unique users. We used cross-validation to evaluate the 4 models, with our deep learning model reaching 95{\%} on F1 score and performing better than the other 3 models. We also found that by removing the hashtags in the text, the model had better performance. Detected posts contained hashtags related to several drugs, including the controlled substance Xanax (1078/1228, 87.78{\%}), oxycodone/OxyContin (321/1228, 26.14{\%}), and illicit drugs lysergic acid diethylamide (213/1228, 17.34{\%}) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (94/1228, 7.65{\%}). We also observed the use of communication applications for suspected drug trading through user comments. Conclusions: Our approach using a combination of Web scraping and deep learning was able to detect illegal online drug sellers on Instagram, with high accuracy. Despite increased scrutiny by regulators and policymakers, the Instagram platform continues to host posts from drug dealers, in violation of federal law. Further action needs to be taken to ensure the safety of social media communities and help put an end to this illicit digital channel of sourcing. ",

    abstract = "{Alcohol misuse is present in over a quarter of trauma patients. Information in the clinical notes of the electronic health record of trauma patients may be used for phenotyping tasks with natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning. The objective of this study is to train and validate an NLP classifier for identifying patients with alcohol misuse.An observational cohort of 1422 adult patients admitted to a trauma center between April 2013 and November 2016. Linguistic processing of clinical notes was performed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The primary analysis was the binary classification of alcohol misuse. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test served as the reference standard.The data corpus comprised 91 045 electronic health record notes and 16 091 features. In the final machine learning classifier, 16 features were selected from the first 24 hours of notes for identifying alcohol misuse. The classifier’s performance in the validation cohort had an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95\\% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.85). Sensitivity and specificity were at 56.0\\% (95\\% CI, 44.1\\% to 68.0\\%) and 88.9\\% (95\\% CI, 84.4\\% to 92.8\\%). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test demonstrates the classifier fits the data well (P = .17). A simpler rule-based keyword approach had a decrease in sensitivity when compared with the NLP classifier from 56.0\\% to 18.2\\%.The NLP classifier has adequate predictive validity for identifying alcohol misuse in trauma centers. External validation is needed before its application to augment screening.}",

abstract = {Abstract Background and aims The experience of alcohol use among adolescents is complex, with international differences in age of purchase and individual differences in consumption and consequences. This latter underlines the importance of prediction modeling of adolescent alcohol use. The current study (a) compared the performance of seven machine-learning algorithms to predict different levels of alcohol use in mid-adolescence and (b) used a cross-cultural cross-study scheme in the training-validation-test process to display the predictive power of the best performing machine-learning algorithm. Design A comparison of seven machine-learning algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, neural network, lasso regression, ridge regression and elastic-net. Setting Canada and Australia. Participants The Canadian sample is part of a 4-year follow-up (2012–16) of the Co-Venture cohort (n = 3826, baseline age 12.8 ± 0.4, 49.2\% girls). The Australian sample is part of a 3-year follow-up (2012–15) of the Climate Schools and Preventure (CAP) cohort (n = 2190, baseline age 13.3 ± 0.3, 43.7\% girls). Measurements The algorithms used several prediction indices, such as F1 prediction score, accuracy, precision, recall, negative predictive value and area under the curve (AUC). Findings Based on prediction indices, the elastic-net machine-learning algorithm showed the best predictive performance in both Canadian (AUC = 0.869 ± 0.066) and Australian (AUC = 0.855 ± 0.072) samples. Domain contribution analysis showed that the highest prediction accuracy indices yielded from models with only psychopathology (AUC = 0.816 ± 0.044/0.790 ± 0.071 in Canada/Australia) and only personality clusters (AUC = 0.776 ± 0.063/0.796 ± 0.066 in Canada/Australia). Similarly, regardless of the level of alcohol use, in both samples, externalizing psychopathologies, alcohol use at baseline and the sensation-seeking personality profile contributed to the prediction. Conclusions Computerized screening software shows promise in predicting the risk of alcohol use among adolescents.},
